# Hackathon
 This project uses machine learning techniques, including CNNs, to detect fraudulent UPI transactions on platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm. The CNN-based model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 99.6%, leveraging user behavior and transaction data for real-time fraud detection.
 The system incorporates various algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) and features a
 web interface for user interaction. Key transaction attributes such as time, type, and user details were
 used to effectively identify malicious activity, demonstrating expertise in fraud detection and machine
 learning applications.
